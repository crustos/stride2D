/// <summary>
/// The data of a MeshRenderer2D component: a convex polygon with a texture coordinate on each point and a tint, drawn where its node is, turned and
/// scaled with it, as a fan of triangles from its first point. This is how a fragment of a shattered sprite is drawn (its points are the piece, its
/// coordinates the piece's place in the sprite's texture), and it draws any convex polygon sprite.
/// <para/>
/// The points are in the node's space; <see cref="Texture"/> says which texture the coordinates are in (0 is the renderer's plain white). Like a sprite,
/// its colour and layer are read every frame, and equal layers are drawn in the order they were enabled. An arena class: a pool of
/// <see cref="CoreLimits.Meshes"/>, recycled when the component is freed.
