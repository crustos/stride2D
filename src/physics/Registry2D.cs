/// Which bodies, colliders and joints exist, and the small arena records that hold the simulation's data for them. Not generic and holding no
/// interface or delegate, so it translates to C (see tools/ccsharp): the engine layer keeps its own table of host objects, indexed by what
/// this hands out.
/// <para/>
/// <b>Why records for bodies and joints, and ids only for colliders.</b> An id by itself is cheaper as an integer: a slot of
/// <see cref="HandleTable"/> costs 4 bytes, where an arena record costs its own fields plus the 8-byte pointer that finds it by index. A
/// record pays for itself when it carries data that is hot and is used through references. A body's pose is written for every moving body on
/// every step, and a joint points at two bodies; a collider here is just an id, so it stays one.
/// <para/>
/// <b>Capacity.</b> Bodies and joints are limited to <see cref="PhysicsLimits"/>; the one past the limit gets -1, never a larger table.
/// Records are made the first time a slot is handed out and recycled afterwards, so the arena is touched only as far as the world has
/// grown. <b>Quarantine</b>, <b>generations</b> and index reuse are <see cref="HandleTable"/>'s, unchanged.
/// <para/>
/// An arena class of capacity 1, like the <see cref="SimCore2D"/> that owns it: one registry per process, which is what lets the core hand out a
/// reference to it. (Under .NET each simulation has its own.)
